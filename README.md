# Pi Conductor

Conductor is a Pi package for delegating coding work without derailing the main chat.

Most coding-agent workflows make one chat do everything: planning, implementation, debugging, review, terminal logs, and follow-up decisions. Over time, the context gets bloated, the agent drifts, and delegation means opening a new window and reconstructing the task by hand.

Conductor keeps the main Pi chat as the engineering cockpit. When work emerges, it helps classify the effort, package a focused handoff, define constraints and evidence expectations, and send the task to the right worker flow so the main conversation can continue.

## Status

Phase 1 scaffold: recommendation-only routing and handoff generation. It does **not** launch subagents or execute an orchestration FSM yet.

## Install locally

Clone or copy this repository to the computer where you want to use it, then run Pi with the local package path:

```bash
cd /path/to/pi-conductor
npm install
pi -e "$PWD"
```

Or install persistently from that local checkout:

```bash
cd /path/to/pi-conductor
npm install
pi install "$PWD"
```

After installing on a new computer, run `/conductor setup` once to create that machine's local Conductor config.

## Commands

```text
/conductor setup
/conductor status
/conductor route <task>
/conductor handoff [instant|fast|careful] <task>
/conductor strict on|off
```

`/conductor handoff` writes a timestamped markdown log under `.pi/conductor/runs/` in the active project.

## What is a handoff?

A handoff is a clean work order for a delegated subagent. It includes:

- goal
- selected route/profile and suggested agent
- allowed files
- execution profile metadata
- non-goals
- stop rules
- validation hints
- required return format

## Defaults

Conductor chooses process, not intelligence. Models are implementation details. The public names are execution profiles/topology constraints, not model-size labels. They are designed around how much disruption, ambiguity, and proof the task requires:

- `instant`: linear direct-worker profile; exact files; no scout; compact return; max worker visits 1
- `fast`: linear direct-worker profile; bounded edits; optional scout if targets are unclear; max worker visits 1
- `careful`: full orchestrated flow; scout + plan + execute + verify + review; max worker visits 3

Default agent names are generic and configurable:

- Instant agents: `delegate`
- Fast agents: `delegate`
- Careful agent: `worker`

Model and agent selection is a configurable implementation detail. By default, model preferences are blank so each agent inherits its normal default. Run `/conductor setup` to customize agents and model preferences from Pi's active model registry, or enter model IDs manually if no registry choices are available.

## Routing rules

- `instant`: exact file or obvious mechanical edit, unambiguous instructions, low blast radius.
- `fast`: small feature/fix, bounded unknowns, low-risk domain, usually no more than a few files.
- `careful`: many files, unclear design, user-visible behavior, risky refactor, or work needing strong evidence/review.

## Execution profile policy

- Instant: linear direct-worker profile; read/edit exact allowed files only; no scout; run requested or narrow validation; return compactly.
- Fast: linear direct-worker profile; bounded edits; optional scout only if target files are unclear.
- Careful: full orchestrated flow; scout + plan + execute + verify + review recommended.

## Positioning

Conductor is not trying to replace the engineer or become another all-in-one coding agent. It is aimed at keeping the engineer in control while making delegation low-friction:

```text
Think here.
Delegate there.
Review evidence back here.
```

Claude Code, OpenCode, Amp, and similar tools are excellent worker environments. Conductor's niche is the layer above that: deciding what kind of work this is, creating the handoff, preserving the main chat's focus, and requiring useful evidence before results come back into the cockpit.

## Phase 2 direction

The next phase will add guarded launch support for fast delegations after explicit approval. Until then, use the generated handoff with your existing subagent workflow.
